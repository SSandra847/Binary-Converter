# Binary-Converter
C# Sharp program that takes a decimal number as input and displays its equivalent in binary form.

Binary is a simple number system that uses only two digits( 0 and 1 ). Using these digits computational problems can be solved by machines because a transistor is used in 0 and 1. That is why this number system is the most preferred in computer engineering.
